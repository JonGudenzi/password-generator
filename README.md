The password generator webpage is where a user can go to have a random password generated by entering certain criteria.

The criteria is presented to the user by a set of prompts and confirms asking them what they would like their password to consist of.

The options the user has to choose from are listed:
  - How many characters the password contains  (Between 8-128)
  - Should the password include special characters
  - Should the password include numbers
  - Should the password include lowercase letters
  - Should the password include uppercase letters

  These questions will appear when the user clicks the generate password button.

Once this occurs the questions are presented in pop-ups as such:

<br>
<img src="images\numbers.PNG" height = "150px" width = "450px">

The password will generate after the last question has been completed and will be based on 
the users confirmed options.
